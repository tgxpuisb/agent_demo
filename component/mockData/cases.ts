Although websites as such do not attract copyright protection, they are made up of works that do. For instance, literary copyright will protect both website code and natural language materials published through the website, while artistic copyright will protect photographs, illustrations and logos.\n\nUsing this copyright statement template, the website operator asserts ownership of copyright in the website and the materials on the website, and sets out the basis upon which others may use the website.\n\nIn addition, the copyright statement incorporates special provisions relating to copyright infringement and copyright-related notifications.\n\nThe template copyright statement may be used on its own, or it may form part of a website's terms and conditions of use.\n\nSection 1: Credit\n\nSection: Free documents licensing warning\n\nOptional element. Although you need to retain the credit, you should remove the inline copyright warning from this document before use.\n\nSection 2: Copyright notice\n\nA copyright notice is an assertion of ownership.\n\nCopyright notices usually take the form specified in Article 3(1) of the Universal Copyright Convention (although the UCC itself is now of very limited significance):\n\n\"Any Contracting State which, under its domestic law, requires as a condition of copyright, compliance with formalities such as deposit, registration, notice, notarial certificates, payment of fees or manufacture or publication in that Contracting State, shall regard these requirements as satisfied with respect to all works protected in accordance with this Convention and first published outside its territory and the author of which is not one of its nationals, if from the time of the first publication all the copies of the work published with the authority of the author or other copyright proprietor bear the symbol © accompanied by the name of the copyright proprietor and the year of first publication placed in such manner and location as to give reasonable notice of claim of copyright.\"\n\nIt will be rare for a website owner to be the sole proprietor of all the copyright in a website. For example, the software code used to run the website may belong to another person. For this reason, the notice here refers also to licensors.\n- *Universal Copyright Convention - http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15381&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html*\n- *Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works - https://wipolex.wipo.int/en/text/283698*\n\nSection 2.1\n- What was the year of first publication of the relevant copyright material (or the range of years)?\n- Who is the principal owner of copyright in the website?\n\nSection 2.3\n\nOptional element.\n\nSection 3: Copyright licence\n\nOptional element.\n\nThe scope of the licence to use will vary with each site. Consider carefully exactly what your users should be allowed to do with your website and material on your website.\n- *Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 - https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48*\n\nSection 3.1\n- Will audio and/or video files be published on the website?\n- Will the website make available any dynamic services to users?\n- Describe the website services in question.\n\nSection 3.2\n\nOptional element.\n\nSection 3.3\n\nOptional element.\n- For what purposes may the website be used?\n\nSection 3.4\n\nOptional element.\n\nSection 3.5\n\nOptional element.\n\nSection 4: Acceptable use\n\nOptional element.\n\nSection 5: Report abuse\n\nWill there be a special procedure (which could be as simple as a designated email address) for reporting abusive conduct or materials on the website?\n\nWebsites that allow the publication of user-generated content should incorporate an abuse reporting procedure. The existence of such a procedure may help the website operator to take advantage of certain defences that may be available in respect of such user generated content.\n\nSection 5.2\n\nOptional element.\n- How can users report unlawful and unwanted materials and activities on the website?\n\nSection 6: Enforcement of copyright\n\nOptional element.\n\nSection 7: Permissions\n\nOptional element.\n\nSection 7.1\n- How should a person go about requesting permission to use copyright materials that are published on the website?",
