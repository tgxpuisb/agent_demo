The Services are intended as an assistive tool and are not a substitute for professional legal judgment, advice, or independent verification.\np29|NL1|AI Limitations: User acknowledges that the Services\np30|LP|\np31|Body Text|utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, which are probabilistic and may produce Output that is inaccurate, incomplete, or contains errors.

User is solely responsible for reviewing, validating, and verifying all Output before relying on or using it.\np32|NL1|No Legal Advice or Attorney-Client Relationship: The Services do not provide legal advice.

By default, requests are processed within Iqidiscontrolled infrastructure using Iqidis’s proprietary systems and orchestration layers. User Content is logically segregated per tenant and per user profile and is not pooled or commingled with other customers’ content. For certain aspects of a request (e.g., language polish, translation, format transformation, or generalknowledge reasoning), the Services may invoke a subprocessor (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) for inference. Vendorside caching/retention is disabled; payloads are minimized; and contractual notraining restrictions apply. Additional detail appears in the Privacy Policy and Subprocessor Policy.\np34|NL0|ACCOUNTS AND REGISTRATION\np35|NL1|Registration: Users may be required to register for an Account to access the Services. User agrees to provide accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current, and complete.\np36|Body Text|Accounts created with false or misleading information— including fake names, disposable emails, or impersonated credentials—are subject to immediate termination.\np37|NL1|Account Security: User is responsible for safeguarding the password and any other credentials used to access the Account.

For avoidance of doubt, access via a free trial does not make the Services or any Non-Public Materials “public.”\np56|NL1|Prohibitions on Reverse Engineering and Unfair Competition: User acknowledges that the Services, including their underlying technology, algorithms, architecture, and design, constitute valuable trade secrets and proprietary intellectual property of Iqidis. Accordingly, in addition to other restrictions set forth in this Agreement, User shall not, and shall not permit or authorize any third party to:\np57|NL0|Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, translate, or otherwise attempt to discover, derive, or reconstruct the source code, object code, underlying structure, ideas, trade secrets, know-how, or algorithms of the Services or any part thereof, including its architecture, features, functions, design, or user interface elements. This prohibition includes, without limitation, any attempt to (i) identify or extract proprietary models, datasets, or prompts used by the Services, or (ii) probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of the Services without Iqidis’s express prior written authorization.\np58|NL0|Access, use, monitor, copy, or benchmark the Services, or any Output (except as expressly permitted for User’s internal business purposes or client services under Section 4.1), for the purpose of developing, building, training, improving, or offering a product or service that is competitive with the Services, or any product or service that uses or replicates similar ideas, features, functions, user experience, or graphics of the Services.

Such conduct constitutes unauthorized access and a material breach of this Agreement.\np63|NL1|Monitoring and Access Control\np64|Body Text|To protect the integrity of the Services and enforce this Agreement, Iqidis reserves the right to monitor and analyze usage patterns, registration behavior, IP address logs, device information, and other technical metadata associated with User access. This includes tracking suspicious or anomalous activity for purposes such as fraud detection, abuse prevention, compliance verification, security auditing, and enforcement of Section 4.3.\np65|H1|Iqidis may restrict, suspend, or terminate access to the Services in its sole discretion based on such monitoring, without notice, if any violation or abuse is suspected and pursue legal remedies to prevent further misuse.\np66|NL0|USER CONTENT AND DATA\np67|NL1|User Content Ownership: As between User and Iqidis, User retains all right, title, and interest in and to User Content, including all Intellectual Property Rights therein.

User acknowledges and agrees to the terms of the Privacy Policy.\np72|NL1|AI Processing and Data Retention: As further detailed in the Privacy Policy, Iqidis utilizes AI technologies that process User Content in real-time. Iqidis does not use User Content to train its own or third-party AI models. User Content processed by the AI system is not retained for AI model training purposes. Iqidis may access User Content only for the limited purposes of providing customer support, troubleshooting technical issues, ensuring service operation, and enforcing this Agreement, subject to the safeguards outlined in the Privacy Policy. Thirdparty model calls are configured with vendor caching/retention disabled and are used for stateless inference; User Content is not used to train Iqidis or thirdparty models.\np73|NL1|Usage Data and Telemetry. Iqidis may collect, analyze, and use aggregated, anonymized data derived from User’s use of the Services (“Usage Data”) and limited operational telemetry (behavioral/interaction metadata, such as UI events/clicks, navigation flows, request timing, status/error codes, and coarse device/browser metadata) for performance monitoring, service improvement, security, and abuse detection. Usage Data and telemetry will not identify User or contain User Confidential Information and do not include prompts, model outputs, or uploaded documents/files.\np74|LP|\np75|NL1|Roles; Ownership; Data Location and Segregation.

User acknowledges that due to the nature of AI, Output may not be unique, and other users may receive similar or identical Output. Iqidis does not claim ownership over Output generated from non-proprietary inputs or widely known information. User’s rights in Output do not extend to underlying Iqidis technology or third-party data that may be incorporated.\np80|NL1|Feedback: User grants Iqidis a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use, modify, incorporate, and otherwise exploit any Feedback provided by User for any purpose, including for service improvement and promotional purposes, without restriction or compensation to User.\np81|NL0|FEES AND PAYMENT\np82|NL1|Fees: User agrees to pay all fees specified in the applicable order form or registration process (“Fees”).

Material changes will be communicated with reasonable advance notice.\np151|NL1|Assignment: Neither party may assign this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations hereunder, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the other party’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld); provided, however, that Iqidis may assign this Agreement in its entirety, without consent, in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets. Any attempted assignment in violation of this section shall be void.\np152|NL1|Relationship of the Parties: The parties are independent contractors.

Additionally, User agrees that Iqidis may use any Feedback provided by User (as defined in Section 6.3), including quotations attributable to User, for marketing and promotional purposes in any media, consistent with the license granted in Section 6.3.
